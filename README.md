# matrix-string-decoder

This project is a Python implementation of a simple **cipher/decoding system** based on square matrices.  
It can take a scrambled string, arrange it into a 2D grid, perform flips and transpositions, and return a readable decoded message.

## âœ¨ Features
- Validate strings (letters + spaces only)
- Check if string length is a perfect square
- Convert strings â†” 2D square lists
- Flip and transpose grids
- Automatically insert spaces in CamelCase strings
- Decode scrambled "grid cipher" messages

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
Clone the repo and run with Python 3:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/string-grid-decoder.git
cd string-grid-decoder
python main.py
